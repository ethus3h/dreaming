One goal of this guild is to provide help to new players, getting them acquainted with the processes of the game.
I'll expand this further…!! <3 ~~CuteFairy

~What servers are you normally on?~ 

-I'm on USEast mainly. (Guwange)

~Help! How do we find each other?~

We can use the interworld guild chat. It can be started by typing "/g" (without the quotation marks). Then, we can ask what realm the other person's in, and then go there :-) ^.^ ~~CuteFairy
