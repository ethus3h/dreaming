You can't steal hope,
You can't kidnap passion.
Chasing sunlight,
You can't take us away.

Create, create, create! When you are stuck, you need to sprint forward as fast as you can... just make a ton of stuff, even if it's shit. You might make 5 songs in 5 days, and 4 of them will be absolute shit, but then you have one good song, which is more than you started out with. —Crywolf (https://www.reddit.com/r/electronicmusic/comments/3uwcfn/im_crywolf_an_indieelectronic_music_producer_and/)

"The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups.
All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality.
His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the “quantity” group: 50 pounds of pots rated an “A”, 40 pounds a “B”, and so on. Those being graded on “quality”, however, needed to produce only one pot — albeit a perfect one — to get an “A”.
Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity.
It seems that while the “quantity” group was busily churning out piles of work—and learning from their mistakes — the “quality” group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay." —Crywolf (https://www.reddit.com/r/electronicmusic/comments/3uwcfn/im_crywolf_an_indieelectronic_music_producer_and/)


Quotation: I thought I had written you about your collection of letters. I did get the book and it was very thoughtful of you to send it to me. We are all in your debt for those letters, especially yours to Julian. They are wise. I know of no other philosopher so sensible of posterity as to keep copies of every letter he writes, realizing that even his most trivial effusion has, in the context of the large body of his work, an eternal value. Hippia joins me in wishing you good health.
