\begin_layout Title
Emerging Technologies Research Paper: Topic Proposal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author

\begin_layout Standard
Electronic document representation models are an emerging technology and
 an area of complex, ongoing research.
 Development of these models began with the advent of telegraphy and has
 continued since then, beginning with early systems such as Morse and Baudot
 code, and moving through teleprinter control systems and more complex models
 such as PDF, TeX, Qt, and PostScript.
 There are four main contexts for which effective representation models
 are needed: process-internal, process-external, line transmission

The distinction between a document representation model used in line transmissio
n and a line transmission protocol is somewhat blurry.

, and user interface.
 The chief problems with current models (mostly multi-layered model stacks
 such as HTML+Unicode) are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Many overlapping models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Many domain-specific models, each with their own drawbacks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Advances in models are not always shared between various application fields
 (e.g.
 a legacy structured data format might require use of ASCII, EBCDIC, or
 another obsolete character encoding system, and not inherit advances made
 in that field such as by Unicode)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
No consistent interchange model for documents (so, e.g., document content
 stored using a page description language such as PostScript may not transfer
 losslessly when used in a GUI toolkit such as Qt GUI)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These drawbacks result in duplicated effort, unnecessary parser, renderer,
 and authoring/editing

(both plain-text authoring/editing such as is typical for source code and
 markup languages, and GUI editing as is typical for graphics files and
 word-processing documents)

 complexity, and frustration for users when software does not behave consistentl
y or interoperate well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My proposed research project is to investigate ways that some or all of
 these challenges can be ameliorated or resolved, and to study previous
 and ongoing work in this area.
